I think this is a great strategy: aligning their internal product to their API makes both improve a lot more over time.

I do understand your concern that product development might suffer from using the same API that users are consuming but, if your number one priority is offering users the best possible experience, that shouldn&#039;t be an issue.]]></description>

Do they really mean exactly the same tools? Was it that their internal API was already suitable for external consumption. Seems like a happy accident.
